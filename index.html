        <b> <p>Real Reviews of ThreadLuxe </p></b>
        <br>
       <p>ThreadLuxe saved my life! I spent hours trying to pick out dresses on other stores, but they were far too expensive. ThreadLuxe helped me find someone with a cheap but beautiful wedding dress that I could wear on my special day! It was beautiful and arrived before time! 10/10 reccommend ThreadLuxe for any other frustrated bride-to-bes!

       <em><p> I am so incredibly happy that ThreadLxe exists!! I was skeptical, but I rented out dress for my daughter. It was this lightish blue with sequions alongside the straps of the back!! It was actually so beautiful for it's price!! I was totally not expecting that. Wiill rent again!!!!

       <em> <p> I thank ThreadLuxe so much for helping find a tuxedo last-minute for a formal party. The website was easy to navigate, and it was e-z finding someone who would lend me a tux. 5/5 website.
